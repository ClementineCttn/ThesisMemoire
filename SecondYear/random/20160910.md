1) Cruchtfield : strong connexion between th. physics == thermodynamics and information theory :: intuition/theory of Paul Bourgine on predictability of complex systems through {\varespilon}-machines

2) debate with Thibault on quanti/quali : Harvey vs Pumain : when does theoretical speculations become theory ? when does ideas are indeed teken seriously ? isn't it when we hav eempirical evidences about thoses ? not sure about that. also not sure how the construction of knowledge is conditionned to social construction, and is this actually an issue ? shall we take science politically or "objectivaly" (assuming we have any definition of that ?) --> paper critisizing Denise, comparing to Harvey and shit, basing on the same theoretical basis how can you come to such different theories ? (NB : basis is Schumpeterian theory of innovation ; could be the same for Aghion -- so far from this ?
